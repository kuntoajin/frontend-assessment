## Acknowledgements

 - I'm using 14 version Next.js because it's released on October 26 and i'm create the project on October 27 | [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14)
 - The reason i'm choose ChakraUI is it's more easier to implement Dark Mode | [ChakraUI Color Mode](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/color-mode)
