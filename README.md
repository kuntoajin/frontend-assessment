# Frontend Assessment

Hello i'm Kunto Aji will deliver the assessment and thank you for choosing me as your candidates. I'm using Next.js (yarn create next-app) for the starting point. Here some brief for the project:


# Design Story
In this project there are two different pages, namely home and product details. The home page contains a product list display along with title, description, image, price and rating. 

There is also input that is used to search for a specific product, if the details page contains an image, title, rating, price, description and rate of this product.

On the home page, there is a list of products that can be clicked, if clicked it will go to the product details page. Both pages support responsiveness so users can access them via mobile devices. Apart from that, there is also a dark mode feature which is marked with the button next to sort selector. Then the next feature is sort selector, there are several types of sort, namely sort by title ascending, sort by title descending, sort by date older, sort by date latest, sort by rating lower, sort by rating higher.

On the detail page, I added an item rate button that allows the user to rate the item.

## Acknowledgements

 - I'm using 14 version Next.js because it's released on October 26 and i'm create the project on October 27 | [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14)
 - The reason i'm choose ChakraUI is it's more easier to implement Dark Mode | [ChakraUI Color Mode](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/color-mode)
